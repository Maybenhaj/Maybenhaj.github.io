                The Seychelles is a paradise with deep blue waters teeming 
                with sea life and gorgeous, unspoiled shores. But there’s more 
                to this remote island archipelago than just beautiful beaches.

                Here are 8 fascinating facts about this incredible archipelago 
                in the Indian Ocean.
            </h3>
            <p>
                1. The Seychelles was once a pirate hideout, in particular Anse 
                Forbans (Pirate’s Cove) on Mahé and Côte d’Or on Praslin. It is 
                believed that famous pirate Olivier Levasseur hid a treasure 
                worth more than $160,000 that remains unfound.
                <br>
                2. Bird Island is home to the heaviest land tortoise living in 
                the wild, Esmeralda, who tips the scales at 670 pounds.
                <br>
                3. Moyenne Island in Saint Anne Marine National Park is 
                believed to be haunted by a spirit that stands guard over 
                buried treasure.
                <br>
                4. The coco de mer, native to the islands, produces the largest
                seed in the world. The distinctly shaped nut can weigh up to 33 
                pounds. 
                <br>
                5. Victoria, the capital of the Seychelles, is the smallest in 
                the world and can be easily explored on foot in less than a day.
                <br>
                6. James Bond author Ian Fleming visited the Seychelles in 1958 
                looking for adventure and inspiration for his then-latest 
                collection of stories, For Your Eyes Only.
                <br>
                7. The Seychelles has some of the rarest endemic birds, 
                including the bare-legged Scops owl, which is so rare that it 
                was once thought to have become extinct before being 
                rediscovered in 1959.
                <br>
                8. Breadfruit is very popular on the Seychelles and can be 
                eaten in a variety of ways from fried to boiled. Legend has 
                it that anyone who eats it while on the islands will 
                return someday.

                    <h2>Anse Marron, La Digue</h2>
                    <p>
                        Locals speak of this wild spot on the southernmost 
                        tip of La Digue with reverence, but word is starting
                        to spread among travellers. A steep hike of several 
                        hours through forest reveals a near-perfect 
                        semicircle of sizeable granite boulders, blocking 
                        off the deep-blue Indian Ocean to leave a natural 
                        saltwater pool. Deep turquoise in colour, it melts 
                        seamlessly into sugar-fine sands
                        Hire a guide to help you find this magical spot; 
                        going alone would be a fool’s errand. Once you’ve 
                        completed your hard-earned dip, you can return to 
                        Le Nautique on the comparatively bustling west coast 
                        for poolside sundowners or snoozes in sea-facing 
                        rooms.
